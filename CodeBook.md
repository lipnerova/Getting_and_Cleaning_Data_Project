##General info
Data and information obtained via Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course. Below are the original comments together with appropriate citation of the source. From the original dataset I choosed just some of the variables and changed their names. In the text below the names of variables are changed so they correspond with the final tidy dataset and omitted variables are omitted form the text too.

## Experiment setting

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' in downloaded files for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.


##Feature Selection 


The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals time_Acceleration_XYZ and time_AngularVelocity_XYZ. These time domain signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (timeBody_Acceleration_XYZ and timeGravity_Acceleration_XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (timeBody_AccelerationJerk_XYZ and timeBody_AngularVelocityJerk_XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (timeBody_Acceleration_Magnitude, timeGravity_Acceleration_Magnitude, timeBody_AccelerationJerk_Magnitude, timeBody_AngularVelocity_Magnitude, timeBody_AngularVelocityJerk_Magnitude). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing freqBody_Acceleration_XYZ, freqBody_AccelerationJerk_XYZ, freqBody_AngularVelocity_XYZ, freqBody_AccelerationJerk_Magnitude, freqBody_AngularVelocity_Magnitude, freqBody_AngularVelocityJerk_Magnitude. (Note the 'freq' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern: '_XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation


Finaly the means for each activity (see below) and each test subject (30 people) were calculated and are reported in final tidy dataset (tidy_dataset.txt).
